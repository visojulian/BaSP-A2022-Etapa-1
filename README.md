### Week 00 - Figma
Created app views in Figma

My personal task was: Employee-views

Only thinking in screenflow and errors

---
### Week 01 - HTML
New folders: Semana-01, assets

Create docs: index.html and README.md

Including: font-awesome icons

This week is only for HTML structure basics. No rush.

### Week 02 - CSS
