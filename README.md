### Week 00 - Figma
Created app views in Figma 

My personal task was: Employee-views

Only thinking in screenflow and errors

---
### Week 01 - HTML
New folders: Semana-01, assets

Create docs: index.html and README.md

Including: font-awesome icons

This week is only for HTML structure basics. No rush.

---
### Week 02 - CSS
New folder: Semana-02, css

Create docs: reset.css and style.css

Focus on styling the landing page. Not responsive yet, only the main concepts. No rush.

---
### Week 03 - Flexbox
New folder: Semana-03

Create docs: header.css - footer.css - main.css - sidebar.css

Applying Flexbox to entire page, making responsive by useing media query breakpoints.
